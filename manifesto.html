     <p> <i> Will Artificial Intelligence replace musicians? </i> </p> 

    <button id="question1-yes" onclick="displayDialogueYes()" > Yes</button>

    <button id= question1-no onclick="displayDialogueNo()"> No </button>
        
    <div id="yes-div" style="display: none;">
        <p> In some senses, yes. Computers are very good at large scale calculation. We can now get them to recognise pattern and, to a lesser extent, reproduce them through computational means.</p>

        <p> If a computer can create a disembodied version of a musician and create music in their style (see multiple attempts on recreation of the works of Bach) does this, haven't we in some senses replaced the musician? </p>

        <p> <b> Replacing musicians with computers forces us to evaluate what it means to create music in the first place. </b> </p>
    </div>

    <div id="no-div" style="display: none;">
        <p>Artificial intelligence won't (most likely) replace musicians outright in the near future. Sentient AI is still mostly only observed in science fiction, although science fiction often shapes our technological landscapes. </p> 
        
        <p> Pushing the sentient narrative is often a political choice to divert people's attention from current technological landscapes and the economical meanings of this. </p>

        <p> <b> Aritificial Intelligence is another technology, as computers, transducers, electricity were before it. The goal of technology should be to help automate processes and allow being human to become easier. </b></p>
