	<p>
		Lizzie Wilson is currently studying a PhD as part of the Media & Arts Technology](http://www.mat.qmul.ac.uk/) centre for doctoral training and part of the [Centre for Digital Music](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk) at Queen Mary, University of London as part of the [Centre for Digital Music](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/). 

<h2> Research </h2>


<p>
Co-creation strategies for human-machine collaboration have been explored in various creative disciplines.
Recent developments in music technology and artificial intelligence have made these creative interactions applicable to the domain of computer music, meaning 
it is now possible to interface with algorithms as creative partners. 
The application of computational creativity research is beginning to be incorporated
within the context of live algorithmic music known as live coding.
However, as music is inherently coupled with affective response, 
it is crucial for any artificial musical intelligence system to consider how to incorporate emotional meaning into collaborative musical actions. 
This work will look at bestowing machine musicians within interactive live coding systems the ability to create affective musical collaborations 
and examine new ways of interfacing with musical algorithms.
